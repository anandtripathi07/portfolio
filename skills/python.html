            I am proficient in Python and have used it for a variety of tasks, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning. I have experience with popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I am also familiar with web frameworks like Flask and Django for building robust and scalable back-end systems. My focus is on writing clean, readable, and efficient Python code to solve complex problems.
