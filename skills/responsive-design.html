            I am committed to creating websites that provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices. I use modern CSS techniques, including media queries, Flexbox, and Grid, to build responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. My focus is on creating a seamless and consistent user experience, whether the user is on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
