            I am skilled in using CSS3 to create visually appealing and responsive layouts. I have experience with Flexbox and Grid to build complex and flexible designs that adapt to different screen sizes. I am also proficient in using CSS preprocessors like Sass to write more maintainable and organized stylesheets. My focus is on creating clean, efficient, and modern designs that enhance the user experience.
