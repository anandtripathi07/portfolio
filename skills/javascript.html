            I have a solid understanding of JavaScript (ES6+) and use it to create dynamic and interactive web applications. I am experienced in manipulating the DOM, handling events, and making asynchronous requests to APIs. I have also worked with popular libraries and frameworks like React to build single-page applications. My goal is to write clean, efficient, and maintainable JavaScript code that powers engaging user experiences.
